version 1.0.0 (2009-08-29)
  * Placed the pkglist.log file in a different directory per process, so
    there is no need for any lock files anymore (thanks for the idea
    Dimitar Stankov)
  * Added support for x86_64 arch, by passing the -64 switch to
    install.sh
  * Added support for OR statements using the "|" operator in dependency
    lists.
  * aaa_elflibs is never listed as a dependency

versjkon 0.9.2 (2009-06-12)
  * Removed some unneeded lowercasing (thanks for the patch Dimitar
    Stankov)

version 0.9.1 (2009-06-12)
  * Fixed use of EXCLUDE environment variable that was broken since
    the addition of -s (thanks for the patch Dimitar Stankov)
  * The ADD environment variable works properly now combined with -s
  * ADD now takes priority over EXCLUDE

version 0.9 (2009-06-11)
  * Added -s option to include version information in dependencies
    list. Creates a slack-required file if combined with -f.

version 0.8.1 (2009-06-09)
  * Apply lock to removing /tmp/depfinder-pkglist.log too
  * Used LOCKFILE variable for the lock file location (thanks for the
    patch Dimitar Stankov)

    installed by default
  * Used basename for the DEPFILENAME (thanks for the patch Dimitar
    Stankov)

  * Apply lock to /tmp/depfinder-pkglist.log, so there is no chance of

    needs util-linux-ng to be installed.

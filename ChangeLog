    a python file with spaces in its filename.

    jobs was larger than the number of libraries included in the
    package
  * Fixed a bug with not splitting the jobs properly resulting to an
    error message

  * Fixed removing default excluded packages

version 1.2.1 (2009-12-13)

version 1.2.0 (2009-12-08)
  * Removed support for the ADD and EXCLUDE environment variables. It's
    easy enough to do this with standard tools like sed, or by editing
    the dependency list manually. No reason to keep complicating
    depfinder for it, lets keep things as simple as possible.
  * Fixed not detecting dependencies when ldd pointed to a symlink to
    the actual library and the symlink was not included in the package
    contents in /var/log/packages/ (thanks Emmanuel Bailleul)
  * Made it possible to launch the installation scripts from a different
    directory

version 1.0.2 (2009-08-30)
  * Bugfixes for the OR statement when outputing to comma separated
    list.

version 1.0.1 (2009-08-30)
  * Bugfixes for the OR statement combined with the -s switch

version 1.0.0 (2009-08-29)
  * Placed the pkglist.log file in a different directory per process, so
    there is no need for any lock files anymore (thanks for the idea
    Dimitar Stankov)
  * Added support for x86_64 arch, by passing the -64 switch to
    install.sh
  * Added support for OR statements using the "|" operator in dependency
    lists.
  * aaa_elflibs is never listed as a dependency

versjkon 0.9.2 (2009-06-12)
  * Removed some unneeded lowercasing (thanks for the patch Dimitar
    Stankov)

version 0.9.1 (2009-06-12)
  * Fixed use of EXCLUDE environment variable that was broken since
    the addition of -s (thanks for the patch Dimitar Stankov)
  * The ADD environment variable works properly now combined with -s
  * ADD now takes priority over EXCLUDE

  * Added -s option to include version information in dependencies
    list. Creates a slack-required file if combined with -f.

version 0.8.1 (2009-06-09)
  * Apply lock to removing /tmp/depfinder-pkglist.log too
  * Used LOCKFILE variable for the lock file location (thanks for the
    patch Dimitar Stankov)
  * /var/lock/depfinder/ with write priviliges for everyone is
    installed by default
  * Used basename for the DEPFILENAME (thanks for the patch Dimitar
    Stankov)

version 0.8 (2009-06-09)
  * Apply lock to /tmp/depfinder-pkglist.log, so there is no chance of
    overwritting the file while reading it (thanks for the idea
    Dimitar Stankov!). flock is used for that, so depfinder now also
    needs util-linux-ng to be installed.

version 0.7.1 (2009-05-10)
  * Fixed receiving a directory as an argument

version 0.7 (2009-05-09)

Installation
------------

To install, just run:

 ./compile.sh

followed by:

 ./install.sh

as root. You can set DESTDIR to change the installation target:

 DESTDIR=/my/custom/installation/target ./install.sh

If you want to install on a x86_64 system, run compile.sh:

 ./compile.sh -64

Actually, what the above command does is just change a single line in
the depfinder executable. There is a
LIBDIRSUFFIX=""
line at the top of that file, that for x86_64 systems should become:
LIBDIRSUFFIX="64"
So you can change it anytime after installation too.

Uninstallation
--------------
To remove, you can just:

 rm /usr/bin/depfinder
 rm /usr/libexec/depfinder-search
 rm /usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/depfinder.mo
